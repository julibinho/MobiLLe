### With [GCtree](https://github.com/matsengrp/gctree) simulator, we produced 12 simulated repertoires with different mutation rates

For each simulated data set, we provide:

* fasta file
* IMGT_highvquest output that is used as input by MobiLLe
* truly clonal relationships according to the simulation
